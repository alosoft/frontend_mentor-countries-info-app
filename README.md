## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

Another React JS #reactjs web app which utilizes REST Countries API #api https://restcountries.com/ and uses dark and light themes.
The apps functionalities were pretty basic but the styling (theming) was the main challenge. I think I should have probably used Styled-Components but I chose to manage the styles my own way by using the Context API since I was already storing state over there.
In the end, am satisfied with the project (at least the themes) :)
